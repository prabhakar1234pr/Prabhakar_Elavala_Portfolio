### Semester Project: Predictive Analytics for Student Success

Working with a team of four students, we developed a machine learning system to predict student academic outcomes based on learning management system data.

**Project Scope:**
- Analyzed Canvas LMS data for 500+ students across multiple courses
- Developed early warning systems for academic intervention
- Created recommendations for personalized learning paths

**Technical Approach:**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Feature engineering for student success prediction
def create_engagement_features(lms_data):
    """Create features from learning management system interactions"""
    
    features = lms_data.groupby('student_id').agg({
        'login_count': 'sum',
        'assignment_submissions': 'count',
        'discussion_posts': 'count',
        'time_spent_online': 'sum',
        'grade': 'mean'
    }).reset_index()
    
    # Create derived features
    features['engagement_score'] = (
        features['login_count'] * 0.2 + 
        features['discussion_posts'] * 0.3 + 
        features['time_spent_online'] * 0.5
    )
    
    return features

# Model development and evaluation
def predict_student_success(features, outcomes):
    """Train model to predict student academic outcomes"""
    
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        features, outcomes, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
    
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    
    return {
        'model': model,
        'predictions': predictions,
        'performance': classification_report(y_test, predictions)
    }
```

**Results and Impact:**
- Achieved 84% accuracy in predicting students at risk of academic difficulty
- Identified key engagement patterns that correlate with success
- Presented findings to university administration for potential implementation

### Individual Research: Bias Detection in Hiring Algorithms

As part of an independent study, I explored algorithmic bias in AI-powered hiring systems, combining technical analysis with ethical considerations.

**Research Questions:**
- How do demographic biases manifest in resume screening algorithms?
- What metrics effectively measure and quantify algorithmic fairness?
- How can bias mitigation techniques maintain predictive performance?

**Methodology:**
- Analyzed publicly available datasets of hiring decisions
- Implemented multiple fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, individual fairness)
- Tested bias mitigation techniques including adversarial debiasing and fair representation learning

**Key Findings:**
- Traditional accuracy metrics often hide significant demographic disparities
- Bias mitigation requires careful balancing of multiple fairness criteria
- Organizational policies and human oversight remain crucial for fair AI implementation
