# Building a Full-Stack Portfolio with Next.js and Three.js

Creating a portfolio website that stands out in today's competitive tech landscape requires more than just listing projects and experiences. Modern portfolios need to demonstrate technical skills while providing engaging user experiences that reflect the creator's personality and capabilities. My journey building a full-stack portfolio using Next.js and Three.js has been both challenging and rewarding, resulting in a platform that showcases not just what I've built, but how I think about user experience, technical architecture, and visual design.

## The Vision: Beyond Traditional Portfolios

Traditional developer portfolios often follow predictable patterns: a hero section, project gallery, about page, and contact form. While functional, these approaches miss opportunities to demonstrate creativity, technical depth, and user experience thinking. I wanted to create something that would:

**Showcase Technical Breadth**: Demonstrate proficiency across frontend, backend, 3D graphics, and AI/ML integration
**Engage Visitors**: Create memorable interactions that encourage exploration
**Reflect Personality**: Express creativity and attention to detail beyond code samples
**Serve Multiple Audiences**: Appeal to potential employers, collaborators, and fellow developers
**Stay Current**: Use modern technologies that reflect industry trends and best practices

## Technology Stack and Architecture

### Frontend Foundation: Next.js 14

Choosing Next.js as the foundation provided several key advantages:

**SEO Benefits**: Server-side rendering and static site generation improve search engine visibility and social media sharing.

**Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and intuitive file-based routing accelerate development.

**Production Readiness**: Deployment optimization and edge computing support through Vercel integration.

```typescript
// Next.js App Router structure for optimal performance
// app/layout.tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next'
import './globals.css'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Prabhakar Elavala - AI/ML Engineer',
  description: 'Portfolio showcasing AI/ML projects, full-stack development, and data science work',
  keywords: ['AI', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Science', 'Full-Stack Development'],
  authors: [{ name: 'Prabhakar Elavala' }],
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Prabhakar Elavala - AI/ML Engineer',
    description: 'Innovative AI/ML solutions and full-stack development',
    url: 'https://prabhakar-elavala-portfolio.vercel.app',
    siteName: 'Prabhakar Elavala Portfolio',
    type: 'website',
  },
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className="scroll-smooth">
      <body className="bg-background text-foreground antialiased">
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### 3D Graphics: React Three Fiber

Integrating Three.js through React Three Fiber created opportunities for immersive visual experiences:

**Component-Based 3D**: React Three Fiber's declarative approach made complex 3D scenes manageable and maintainable.

**Performance Optimization**: Built-in optimization features like automatic disposal and efficient re-rendering.

**Interactive Elements**: Seamless integration of 3D elements with traditional React components.

```typescript
// Interactive 3D hero section component
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { Stars, OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

function HeroScene() {
  return (
    <div className="absolute inset-0 -z-10">
      <Suspense fallback={null}>
        <Canvas 
          dpr={[1, 1.5]} 
          camera={{ position: [0, 1.2, 7.5], fov: 60 }}
          gl={{ antialias: true, alpha: true }}
        >
          {/* Dynamic star field background */}
          <Stars 
            radius={60} 
            depth={50} 
            count={4000} 
            factor={2} 
            fade 
            speed={0.6} 
          />
          
          {/* Ambient lighting for depth */}
          <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
          <directionalLight position={[5, 7, 5]} intensity={1} />
          
          {/* Interactive camera controls */}
          <CameraRig />
          
          {/* Futuristic grid floor */}
          <GridFloor />
          
          {/* Floating geometric elements */}
          <FloatingElements />
        </Canvas>
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  )
}

function CameraRig() {
  const { mouse } = useThree()
  
  useFrame((state) => {
    // Subtle camera movement following mouse
    state.camera.position.x = THREE.MathUtils.lerp(
      state.camera.position.x, 
      mouse.x * 0.5, 
      0.03
    )
    state.camera.position.y = THREE.MathUtils.lerp(
      state.camera.position.y, 
      mouse.y * 0.3 + 1.2, 
      0.03
    )
    state.camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0)
  })
  
  return null
}
```

export const Card = ({ children, className, ...props }: CardProps) => (
  <div
    className={cn(
      "bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/10",
      "hover:border-purple-300/30 transition-all duration-300",
      "hover:translate-y-[-4px] hover:shadow-2xl hover:shadow-purple-500/10",
      "rounded-lg p-6",
      className
    )}
    {...props}
  >
    {children}
  </div>
)

export const GradientText = ({ children, className }: GradientTextProps) => (
  <span 
    className={cn(
      "bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-400 to-blue-400 bg-clip-text text-transparent",
      className
    )}
  >
    {children}
  </span>
)
```

## Key Features and Implementation

### Interactive Project Showcase

Rather than static project cards, I created an interactive showcase that demonstrates both the projects and the portfolio's own technical capabilities:

**Live Demos and Code Links**: Direct access to working applications and source code repositories.

**Technology Tag System**: Visual categorization that helps visitors quickly identify relevant projects based on their interests.

```typescript
// Dynamic project showcase with filtering and search
function ProjectsPage() {
  const [selectedTags, setSelectedTags] = useState<string[]>([])
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('')
  
  const filteredProjects = useMemo(() => {
    return projects.filter(project => {
      const matchesSearch = project.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
                           project.summary.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
      
      const matchesTags = selectedTags.length === 0 || 
                         selectedTags.some(tag => project.tech.includes(tag))
      
      return matchesSearch && matchesTags
    })
  }, [searchTerm, selectedTags])
  
  return (
    <div className="mx-auto max-w-6xl px-6 py-12">
      {/* Interactive filters */}
      <ProjectFilters 
        selectedTags={selectedTags}
        onTagsChange={setSelectedTags}
        searchTerm={searchTerm}
        onSearchChange={setSearchTerm}
      />
      
      {/* Animated project grid */}
      <motion.div 
        className="grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-2"
        layout
      >
        <AnimatePresence>
          {filteredProjects.map((project) => (
            <ProjectCard 
              key={project.title}
              project={project}
              layout
              initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 }}
              animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
              exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 }}
              transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
            />
          ))}
        </AnimatePresence>
      </motion.div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

    // Attempt GROQ API call with fallback
    const response = await groq.chat.completions.create({
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
        ...messages
      ],
      model: "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 1000
    })
    
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      content: response.choices[0].message.content 
    })
    
  } catch (error) {
    // Intelligent fallback responses
    return NextResponse.json({
